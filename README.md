# Feature Request Application

This project is being developed in concert with the front end to be found at this repository:
https://github.com/javatami/features-vue

## Instructions for Running:
- Clone the project
- Navigate to the directory in a terminal
- ./mvnw spring-boot:run

## Assumptions:
This project would be integrated into a larger project. Therefore, I made decisions regarding the following:
- Rather than mySQL, I chose a temporary H2 database
- No security as I assume it would be integrated into a single sign on solution

## ToDo (unrelated to code):
- README
- Swagger doc
- Containerize
